Still, this path downplays her despair, financial strain, and the torn note—signals that she might have already been close to the edge.",
      "Undetermined": "You chose Undetermined. You recognized the contradictions and accepted uncertainty—balancing internal struggles against signs of external involvement. This reflects caution and realism: some cases resist neat answers, and Room 103 may remain open pending further investigation."
